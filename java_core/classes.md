# Classes

A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. In general, class declarations can
include these components, in order:

- Modifiers: A class can be public or has default access.
- class keyword: class keyword is used to create a class.
- Class name: The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).
- Superclass(if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can
  only extend (subclass) one parent.
- Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword
  implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
- Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.

Constructors are used for initializing new objects. Fields are variables that provides the state of the class and its
objects, and methods are used to implement the behavior of the class and its objects. There are various types of classes
that are used in real time applications such as nested classes, anonymous classes, lambda expressions. It represents the
set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.
