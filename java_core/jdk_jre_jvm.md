# JDK

JDK (Java Development Kit) is a Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program. JDK is a
kit(or package) that includes two things
Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
JRE (to execute your java program).

# JRE

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to only run(not develop) the java
program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs that are
end-users of your system.

# JVM

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an implementation of a specification, detailing the behavior expected of a JVM. Any
implementation that conforms to the JVM specification should be able to run code compiled into Java bytecode
irrespective of the language in which the code was originally written. In the Java programming language, all source code
is first written in plain text files ending with the .java extension. Those source files are then compiled into .class
files by the javac compiler. A .class file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains
bytecodes, the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine. The java launcher tool then runs your application with an
instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.
Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line
by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter.
