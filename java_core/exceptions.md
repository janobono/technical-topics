# Exceptions

An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. When an Exception occurs
the normal flow of the program is disrupted and the program/Application terminates abnormally, which is not recommended,
therefore, these exceptions are to be handled.

An exception can occur for many different reasons. Following are some scenarios where an exception occurs.

- A user has entered an invalid data.
- A file that needs to be opened cannot be found.
- A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications or the JVM has run out of memory.

Some of these exceptions are caused by user error, others by programmer error, and others by physical resources that
have failed in some manner. Based on these, we have three categories of Exceptions. You need to understand them to know
how exception handling works in Java.

- Checked exceptions − A checked exception is an exception that is checked (notified) by the compiler at
  compilation-time, these are also called as compile time exceptions. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored, the
  programmer should take care of (handle) these exceptions.
- Unchecked exceptions − An unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution. These are also
  called as Runtime Exceptions. These include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. Runtime
  exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.
- Errors − These are not exceptions at all, but problems that arise beyond the control of the user or the programmer.
  Errors are typically ignored in your code because you can rarely do anything about an error. For example, if a stack
  overflow occurs, an error will arise. They are also ignored at the time of compilation.

## Exception Hierarchy

All exception classes are subtypes of the java.lang.Exception class. The exception class is a subclass of the Throwable
class. Other than the exception class there is another subclass called Error which is derived from the Throwable class.

Errors are abnormal conditions that happen in case of severe failures, these are not handled by the Java programs.
Errors are generated to indicate errors generated by the runtime environment. Example: JVM is out of memory. Normally,
programs cannot recover from errors.
