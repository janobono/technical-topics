# Race condition

Race condition in Java is a type of concurrency bug or issue that is introduced in your program because of parallel
execution of your program by multiple threads at the same time, Since Java is a multi-threaded programming language
hence the risk of Race condition is higher in Java which demands a clear understanding of what causes a race condition
and how to avoid that. Anyway, Race conditions are just one of the hazards or risks presented by the use of
multi-threading in Java just like deadlock in Java. Race conditions occur when two threads operate on the same object
without proper synchronization and their operation interleaves on each other.
