# Thread.sleep()

Thread.sleep() method can be used to pause the execution of current thread for specified time in milliseconds. The
argument value for milliseconds canâ€™t be negative, else it throws IllegalArgumentException.

Java Thread Sleep important points

- It always pause the current thread execution.
- The actual time thread sleeps before waking up and start execution depends on system timers and schedulers. For a
  quiet system, the actual time for sleep is near to the specified sleep time but for a busy system it will be little
  bit more.
- Thread sleep doesn't lose any monitors or locks current thread has acquired.
- Any other thread can interrupt the current thread in sleep, in that case InterruptedException is thrown.

## How Thread Sleep Works

Thread.sleep() interacts with the thread scheduler to put the current thread in wait state for specified period of time.
Once the wait time is over, thread state is changed to runnable state and wait for the CPU for further execution. So the
actual time that current thread sleep depends on the thread scheduler that is part of operating system.
