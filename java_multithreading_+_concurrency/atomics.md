# Atomics

In Java, atomic variables and operations used in concurrency. The multi-threading environment leads to a problem when
concurrency is unified. The shared entity such as objects and variables may be changed during the execution of the
program. Hence, they may lead to inconsistency of the program. So, it is important to take care of the shared entity
while accessing concurrently. In such cases, the atomic variable can be a solution to it.
